just a simple fun tic-tac-toe game made in python from scratch while I was learning the basics and fundamentals of Python. Python version used in 3.8.5. external library used- colorama, internal library used- itertools. you can use another external library- numpy, and can use the numpy.zeros function to easily make the matrix of the tic tac toa game field/board.
